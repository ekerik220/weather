## Introduction

A personal project I made to learn how to use an API and location services in Javascript.

The application displays the current and weekly weather conditions for the user's current location.
Weather data is from Dark Sky API (https://darksky.net/dev).
locationiq API is used for reverse geocoding the user's city name (https://locationiq.com/).
